	  <h3>Where did this come from?</h3>
	  <p>HackingPot was made as a final project for <a href="http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs101/CourseRev/apr2012">Udacity's CS101 course</a>. I've had the idea for quite some time, but since I couldn't program very well, I kept hitting a wall. Thanks to Udacity - special thanks to Dave Evans and Peter Thrun - I was able to take this idea out of the drawing board.</p>
		<br>
	  <h3>Why did I make this?</h3>
	  <p>I really enjoy doing DIY projects, the thing is I don't have much time to dedicate to them. Sometimes I find myself with a weekend off when I can build something but I never knew what to build. With this search engine I can now find cool projects using what I have available!</p>
		<br>
		<h3>What did I use to build it?</h3>
		  <p>This website is basically made in <a href="www.python.org">Python</a>. I did use some <a href="www.djangoproject.org">Django</a> to handle the server side and also the excellent <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> with <a href="https://github.com/rbrady/django-bootstrapped">Django-Bootstrapped</a> and <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a> template to give it some style. <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> was also used in the crawler.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Is the source code available?</h3>
		  <p>Yes! You can review and download the code at <a href="https://github.com/gcmartinelli/HackingPot">GitHub</a>.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Any tips for people wanting to learn how to program?</h3>
		  <p>Yes! Look for courses at <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>, <a href="www.codecademy.com">CodeCademy</a> and <a href="www.kahnacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>. It's never been easier to learn how to program, I wish I had this opportunity sooner! Regarding what language I recommend beginners... without a doubt: Python! :)</p>
