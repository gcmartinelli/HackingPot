Hello world!
Hackingpot.com was a project made for the final hexamester (APR/2012) competition from Udacity's CS101 course.

Hackingpot.com is a "reverse search engine" that shows DIY projects based on what components you have available for a build.

This repo contains the initial code for HP, including search engine and crawler.
